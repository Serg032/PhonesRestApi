# PhonesRestApi
Hello everyone!!

This is the REST API that I have done for the Zignaly Test.

1. First of all, you have to Clone this Repository.
2. npm install (Terminal)
3. npm run dev: The server is working at this point.
4. You will need to create a .env with 2 environment variable: DB_URL(MongoDB url with your password) and DATABASE(name of the database)
5.  You need to have some smartphones created for have a nice web experience so do it.
6.  Example of the request body you will need: 
 {
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "color": "string",
    "price": "number"
 }
 7. If You do all this steps you are in my Phone World!!
